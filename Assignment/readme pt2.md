You may add one signature screenshot of your program here or above the title. Check out [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/markdown-markdown-images) to learn how to do it.

Please provide the YouTube link to your [Video Demo](https://youtu.be/HnrXPMvnYnY).

## Compilation Instructions

Provide instructions on how to compile your program, especially when it is non-trivial.

For example:

g++ readme.md


## User Manual

Please provide the user manual on how to use your program.
USER MANUAL 
Assignment (Part 1 & 2)



When you run the code, you will be asked to enter your name, and then you will be prompted with the option to start the game or exit. Enter "Y" to start the game or "N" to exit.


2)If you enter "N," you will be prompted again to confirm if you want to exit or start the game and if you enter  “Y” for exit the game will end .


3)If you choose to start the game, you will be asked if you want to customise the settings or use the default settings.


4) If you choose to customise the settings, you will be prompted to enter the number of rows and columns, and the number of zombies in the game. You must enter an odd number for both rows and columns. You can choose to have 2-9 zombies in the game. If you enter an invalid input, the program will ask you to enter a valid input.


5) Once you have customised the settings, the game will start, and you will see a grid with aliens, zombies, and the player's position represented by the letter "A." The grid will also have letters that represent the borders and spaces in the grid. To move the player, you can enter "up" to move up, "down" to move down, "left" to move left, and "right" to move right. You will be asked to enter your move after each turn. You must enter a valid input; otherwise, the program will ask you to enter a valid input.


6) when the user faces any difficulties in playing the game. The user can type”menu” to get the list of the commands for the whole game.   



7) When the user wants to change the direction of the arrow, the user can type “menu” the “arrow” to change the arrow. The user have to type the coordinate of the board so the user can change the specific arrow. 

8) In the image above we can see that the particular arrow changed the direction as the user mentioned. 

9) When the command was up the alien moved up as the command. So these will happen for every command which is down,left and right. 


10) When the alien hits the “H” which is the health, the health of the alien will increase by 5. The same thing will repeat each time the alien hits the “H”.


11) When the user wants to save, load or quit from the game, we need to command the menu first then only can do these things. But we are so sorry unfortunately we didn’t implement the save and load component in this game yet. 


11) When the user wants to load, they also have to repeat the same thing I mentioned in step 10.


12) When the user wants to quit from the game they have to command the menu first then can quit from the game as in the image above.
